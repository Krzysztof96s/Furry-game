# Furry-game

A simple game written in JavaScript. Rules are similar to the popular Snake game. We move around the board about
size 10x10 Furry title fields using the arrows. Our task is to collect as many coins as possible
appearing in randomly selected places on the board. When a player hits the wall of the board, the game ends.
